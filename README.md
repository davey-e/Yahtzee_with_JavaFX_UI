# Yahtzee_with_JavaFX_UI
Taking the work from my CodeClan Java project (https://github.com/davey-e/project2_week9_java_yahtzee_game) and extending it to add a JavaFX UI

The original Yahtzee project was created in IntelliJ IDEA and just had a terminal based UI.
I initially tried getting JavaFX to work in IDEA, but couldn't get it to work :(
So instead I'm using NetBeans to create this project and I've just copied the class files over from the original project into this new NetBeans project
I'll then be building the UI using FXML and build the code behind using the existing Yahtzee classes and some extra code to control the game flow
